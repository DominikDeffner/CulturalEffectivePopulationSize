Simulation code for 
- One-to-many and frequency-dependent cultural transmission (SimOTMFrecDep.R)
- Connectedness among populations through migration or cultural exchange (SimConnectedness.R)
- Social network structures (SimNetworks.R)
- Alternative migration mechanism where constant immigration increases census size in focal population (SimAltMig.R)
